# Argo

## Rationale

- Investigate the feasibility of converting shipyard functions to argo.
  For that purpose improvments have been made and proposed to the argo community.
- This is not a "replacement" for airship shipyard. This POC merely aims
  at highlighting the potential advantages and pitfall in going in that
  direction.

## Lessons Learned

### Workflow

- TBD


## Documentation

- [ReadTheDocs](https://airshipit.readthedocs.io/projects/shipyard/en/latest/)
