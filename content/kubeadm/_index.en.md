# Kubeadm

## Rationale

- Investigate the feasibility of converting promenade functions to kubeadm.
  For that purpose improvments have been made and proposed to the kubeadm community.
- This is not a "replacement" for airship promenade. This POC merely aims
  at highlighting the potential advantages and pitfall in going in that
  direction.

## Lessons Learned
